## 2. Technical Architecture Decisions

### 2.1 Framework Selection: Angular 19 + Analog

**Decision Rationale:**
- **Angular 19**: Latest LTS with signals, standalone components, and improved performance
- **Analog Meta-Framework**: Provides file-based routing, API routes, and SSR out-of-the-box
- **Modern Development**: Vite integration for fast builds and hot module replacement

**Benefits Realized:**
```typescript
// Example: Signal-based state management
const selectedRoomId = signal('');
const contactModalOpen = signal(false);

// Automatic reactivity without RxJS complexity
selectedRoomId.set(newRoomId);
```

**Technical Advantages:**
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Improved SEO and initial load performance
- **File-Based Routing**: Intuitive page organization
- **API Routes**: Full-stack capabilities without separate backend
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript integration

### 2.2 Styling Architecture: Tailwind CSS v4

**Decision Rationale:**
- **Design System Integration**: Custom Fresh Projects brand colors and typography
- **Utility-First Approach**: Rapid development with consistent design
- **Dark Mode Support**: Built-in theme switching capabilities

**Implementation Highlights:**
```javascript
// Custom theme extension for Fresh Projects branding
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#74BA43',
      success: '#42758F',
      'dark-background': '#3D3D3C',
      'light-background': '#F0F5FF',
    }
  }
}
```

### 2.3 Data Architecture: Static JSON with API Routes

**Decision Rationale:**
- **Simplicity**: No database setup required for demonstration
- **Flexibility**: Easy content modification and testing
- **API Pattern**: Demonstrates proper API design principles
- **Scalability**: Clear migration path to database solution

**Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// API route structure
/api/v1/properties        // GET all properties
/api/v1/properties/[id]   // GET specific property
/api/v1/rooms            // GET all rooms
/api/v1/contact          // POST contact forms
```

### 5.2 Interactive Floorplan Innovation
**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Coordinate-based room mapping
coordinates: {
  x: 232, y: 285,     // Position on floorplan
  width: 533, height: 298  // Clickable area dimensions
}

// Responsive positioning calculation
getPercentPosition(pixelValue: number, isHorizontal: boolean): number {
  const reference = this.orientation === 'horizontal' 
    ? this.referenceWidth : this.referenceHeight;
  return (pixelValue / reference) * 100;
}
```

**UX Considerations:**

## 6. Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 6.1 Production Deployment Challenges
**Challenge**: File path resolution between development and production environments

**Solution**: Environment-aware path resolution
```typescript
function getDataPath(filename: string): string {
  const isDev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';
  return isDev 
    ? path.join(process.cwd(), 'src/server/data', filename)
    : path.join(process.cwd(), 'dist/server/data', filename);
}
```

### 6.2 Image Optimization Pipeline
**Challenge**: Multiple image formats and sizes for performance optimization

**Solution**: Custom Node.js processing tool
```javascript
// Automated image processing
await sharp(filePath)
  .resize(config.sizes.room.width, config.sizes.room.height)
  .jpeg({ quality: config.quality.high })
  .toFile(outputPath);
```

### 6.3 State Management with Signals
**Challenge**: Complex component interactions without over-engineering

**Solution**: Angular Signals for reactive state
```typescript
// Simple, reactive state management
const selectedRoom = signal<Room | null>(null);
const loading = signal<boolean>(false);

// Automatic UI updates
effect(() => {
  if (this.selectedRoom()) {
    this.loadRoomPhotos();
  }
});
```
