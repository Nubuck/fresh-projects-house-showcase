In this chat we will elevate the Fresh Projects House Showcase application to the next level by branding the app Fresh Places, enhance the app layout to look more like a simplified modern real estate website than a sample project and we will add 1 more property to the application.

I have generated a second floor plan and room images for a second property because a single property is not enough to showcase the application's capabilities. 

I have attached the 2 property floorplans: floorplan1.jpg and floorplan2.jpg. Floorplan1.jpg is a horizontally oriented image while floorplan2.jpg is a vertically oriented image.  Please use floorplan1.jpg for property-1 and floorplan2.jpg for property-2. 

Let's start with data and asset preparation:

Floorplan 1 is a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment unit with a kitchen, balcony and living room. The images provided for the assessment indicate is quite upmarket with a more classical finish - modern kitchen and bathroom but rustic feel in the bedrooms and living room

Floorplan 2 is a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment in an upscale modern and minimalist building complex. The kitchen is open plan to the living room and flows into the balcony. The shared space garden of the complex has beautiful gardens for luxurious and stylish living.

The images for floorplan 1 are all jpgs while the images for floorplan 2 are all png because I used AI to generate them.

Now part of the assessment challenge is performance optimization, and with online stores and real estate sites loading time is important.
To address this please help with the following:

- Generate fresh property data for the 2 properties in JSON format that includes all the details needed to populate the application.  
  - Include a description of the property, the price, the address, the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area, type, and any other relevant details.
  - The most important change here is how we handle the images, we need to provision for the floorplan orientation and all other images must have a low res and high res version. the low res version will be served on page load and the high res will be lazy loaded or used in an image viewing component
- Write a cli tool for the project to generate the low res and high res versions of the images, if the image is a png convert it to a jpg.
  - The cli tool will iterate over folders of images, assuming the following structure for example - there maybe bedroom1, bedroom2, etc.:
    - /property-1
      - floorplan.jpg
      - living-room.jpg
      - bedroom.jpg
      - bathroom.jpg
      - balcony.jpg
    - /property-2
      - floorplan.png
      - living-room.png
      - bedroom.png
      - bathroom.png
      - balcony.png
  - The cli tool will resize the images to the sizes and resolutions you recommend for this application

The second important part I need your help with is the image map coordinates for the 2 floorplans.  Please provide the coordinates for the 2 floorplans in JSON format and if you find it difficult to judge where the rooms borders are please recommend a tool I can draw the squares over the rools to extract the x, y, width and height coordinates for the image maps. 
We wont do 2 versions of the floor plan, there will only be 1 resolution so we dont need to adjust the coordinates for different resolutions.

Please ask any clarifying questions you may have and then proceed with the above.

Images prepared in ./images. I get this error running the script:

Great that worked well. I now have public/assets/images/property-1 and public/assets/images/property-2 with the processed images. I have updated the repomix.xml file and project context documents in project knowledge.

Lets update the server/data files now, I see we have several snippets above for property 1 and 2 plus the rooms, please help me combine that all for the server data json files and update any of the API routes if needed before we move onto the pages enhancements - do you think we should start a new chat for the UI enhancements?

I'm not sure what happened with the latest updated included in the repomix file but the floor plan image is rendering with [object HTMLImageElement] in the src attribute shown below - the image map buttons are also not clickable when navigating client side, only server rendered works

<img _ngcontent-ng-c3837602679="" alt="Floorplan" usemap="#floorplan" class="w-full border border-gray-200 rounded-lg" src="[object HTMLImageElement]">

I'm thinking the absolute coordinates for the image map are currently not scaling well for smaller screen sizes down to mobile which is an assessment requirement - should we maybe not look at rather a layer of absolute positioned elements over the image, maybe percentage based - ideally instead of a button I would like the area of the floorplan to be clickable and have a hover effect with an opacity - much more premium experience

---

repomix file updated, notice the  console.log('SELECT', roomId) in the floorplan component in the selectRoom method and the console.log('SELECTED', roomId) in the onRoomSelected method of the property detail page - when client navigating to the property detail page and clicking on a room the console logs SELECT roomid and SELECTED roomid but the selected room layer is not updated and the room details are not populated - should this.selectedRoomId be a signal or are the components configured with incorrect updating strategies?

---

In our previous chat we updated the property data, floor plan component to use absolutely positioned elements over the image, percentage based to handle responsive screen sizes - we implemented signals for change detection and all working - now we need to focus on the UI design and user experience as well as solve the room layers positioning and size.
I have attached the current layout of the index page as index-page.PNG and the top of the property detail page as property-detail-page-1.PNG and the floor plan section as property-detail-page-2.PNG - from these we can see the layout and UI design is rough and not professional
I have also attached a screenshot of the Fresh Projects site as reference as fresh-projects-reference.PNG to show how they apply the theme colors we have adopted and the size and positioning of their logo.
I have also attached template screenshots from a tailwind html page we created during brainstorming - it's over the top with more elements than needed but shows where we were aiming, these images are template-detail-page1.PNG and template-detail-page2.PNG.

For this chat I want to:

- create a site header with the fresh projects logo I have included in the repomix file as src/fresh-projects-logo.svg - the site header should have the brand name Fresh Places - and a nav item to get back to the index listings page
- The index property listing cards do not look good and give too much negative space - can the cards rather stack vertically and take up the full width of the container - the image on the left and the details aligned to the right of it like a row that wraps neatly for smaller screens
- The property detail page needs a lot of work, please help me with the following:
  - The page title and price should be centered and the price should be larger
  - The property stats should be in a card below the title and price
  - The floorplan and room details should be in a card below the property stats
  - The room details should be in a card to the right of the floorplan
- The floor plan selectable layers must contain the labels in a single element centered - having 2 elements per room is messy - refer to template-detail-page2.PNG to the goal - the selected layer should have an opacity to inidicate it is selected but also show the floorplan below - hovering the layer should change the opacity to indicate it is clickable
  - The clickable layers should be a percentage based size and position to the floorplan image to handle responsive screen sizes
  - The clickable layers should have a border when hovered or selected to indicate it is clickable and selected respectively
- The Room images should be lazy loaded for high res but load the low res when server rendered.
